# Raffle Prize Picker

This project collects five participant names from the user and stores them in a list. After all names are entered, the program uses `random.sample()` to randomly select three unique winners from the list. Each selected winner is printed in the order chosen, and the third winner is clearly marked as the Grand Prize winner. This script practices user input, loops, list handling, and random selection without repeats.

## How It Works
1. The program asks the user to enter five names.
2. Each name is added to a list as it is entered.
3. Once all five names are collected, `random.sample()` selects three different winners at random.
4. The winners are printed in order.
5. The third winner is announced as the Grand Prize winner.
